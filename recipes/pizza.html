    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
      <li>½ heaping cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>8 ounces fresh bocconcini mozzarella, sliced</li>

      <li>10 basil leaves</li>
      <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
